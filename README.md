# üåç Country Explorer API

A TypeScript + Hapi.js API that fetches country data from the REST Countries API, stores it in a PostgreSQL database, and provides full CRUD endpoints.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- PostgreSQL

### Setup

```bash
git clone <repo>
cd country-explorer-api
npm install
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/country_explorer"
```

Note: You may need to update the DATABASE_URL to point to your local DB. Once it is done, you'll have to execute the following commands:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
npx prisma generate

```

#### Start Dev Server

```bash
npx ts-node-dev src/index.ts
```

OR

```bash
npm run start
```

#### Endpoints

```bash
GET /fetch-countries: Fetch and store all countries
GET /countries: List all countries
POST /countries: Add new country
PUT /countries/{id}: Update country
DELETE /countries/{id}: Delete country
```
